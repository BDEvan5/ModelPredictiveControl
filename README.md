# ModelPredictiveControl

This repo is a reference for model predictive control algorithms for vehicles.

It is focused on education and builds up from a simple model with only position and yaw to more complex models.

> **Note:** The algorithms expect a time parameterised trajectory to be followed. 

Currently available:
1. FirstOrderMPC: Position and yaw angle
    - SingleStepOptimisation: shows a single step of the MPC to demonstrate how the optimisation works
    - FirstOrderMPC: complete implementation for example path

Planned:
- Position, yaw and steering
